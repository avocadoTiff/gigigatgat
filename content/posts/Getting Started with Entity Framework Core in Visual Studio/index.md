In this article, we'll gain a basic understanding of Entity Framework Core and demonstrate how it streamlines the process of connecting databases to your web pages. You'll also find step-by-step instructions to help you get started, regardless of whether you're a Windows or Mac user. Since I'm a Mac user, most of the screenshots in this tutorial will be from a Mac system.

## What is Entity Framework Core?

**Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is an open-source and lightweight framework developed by Microsoft. It is widely used in .NET applications to help developers interact with relational databases and convert data into entity classes in a more object-oriented manner. This tool also enables automatic generation of Razor pages with accessible data and default layout settings.

You can install EF Core on NuGet public domain to your web application projects in Visual Studio.
